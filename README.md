## Code
KLCord has a very simple codebase right now. Even if you're not great at Rust yet, it shouldn't be very hard to work with! Take a look at the Issues if you want to work on something. You might want a basic familiarization with [Keynergy](https://github.com/keynergy/keynergy-lib) and [Serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity).
